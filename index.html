											<h3>Estimation of tumor cell total mRNA expression in
15 cancer types predicts disease progression</h3>
											<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing studies have suggested that total mRNA content correlates with tumor phenotypes. Technical and
analytical challenges, however, have so far impeded at-scale pan-cancer examination of total mRNA content. Here we present
a method to quantify tumor-specific total mRNA expression (TmS) from bulk sequencing data, taking into account tumor transcript proportion, purity and ploidy, which are estimated through transcriptomic/genomic deconvolution. We estimate and validate TmS in 6,590 patient tumors across 15 cancer types, identifying significant inter-tumor variability. Across cancers, high
TmS is associated with increased risk of disease progression and death. TmS is influenced by cancer-specific patterns of gene
alteration and intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity as well as by pan-cancer trends in metabolic dysregulation. Taken together,
our results indicate that measuring cell-type-specific total mRNA expression in tumor cells predicts tumor phenotypes and
clinical outcomes.</p>

											<h3>Impact of Somatic Mutations on Survival Outcomes in Patients With Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma</h3>
											<p>Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) uniformly present with aggressive disease, but the mutational
landscape of tumors varies. We aimed to determine whether tumor mutations affect survival outcomes in ATC. Patients who underwent mutation sequencing using targeted gene panels between
2005 and 2019 at a tertiary referral center were included. Associations between mutation status and survival
outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models.A total of 202 patients were included, where 122 died of ATC (60%). The median follow-up was
31 months (interquartile range, 18-45 months). The most common mutations were in TP53 (59%), BRAF
(41%), TERT promoter (37%), and the RAS gene family (22%). Clinicopathologic characteristics and overall
survival (OS) significantly correlated with mutations in BRAFV600E and RAS, which were mutually exclusive. Mutation analysis provides prognostic information in ATC and should be incorporated into routine
clinical care.</p>

Abstract
Accurate detection of somatic mutations in genetically heterogeneous tumor cell populations using next-generation sequencing remains challenging. We have developed MuSE, Mutation calling using a Markov Substitution model for Evolution, a novel approach for modeling the evolution of the allelic composition of tumor and normal tissue at each reference base. It adopts a sample-specific error model to depict inter-tumor heterogeneity, which greatly improves the overall accuracy. Here, we describe the method and provide a tutorial on the installation and application of MuSE.</p>

											<h3>CliP: subclonal architecture reconstruction of cancer cells in DNA sequencing data using a penalized likelihood model</h3>
											<p>Subpopulations of tumor cells characterized by mutation profiles may confer differential fitness and consequently influence prognosis of cancers. Understanding subclonal architecture has the potential to provide biological insight in tumor evolution and advance precision cancer treatment. Recent methods comprehensively integrate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number aberrations (CNAs) to reconstruct subclonal architecture using whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing (WGS, WES) data from bulk tumor samples. However, the commonly used Bayesian methods require a large amount of computational resources, a prior knowledge of the number of subclones, and extensive post-processing. Regularized likelihood modeling approach, never explored for subclonal reconstruction, can inherently address these drawbacks. We therefore propose a model-based method, Clonal structure identification through pair-wise Penalization, or CliP, for clustering subclonal mutations without prior knowledge or post-processing. The CliP model is applicable to genomic regions with or without CNAs. CliP demonstrates high accuracy in subclonal reconstruction through extensive simulation studies. Utilizing the well-established regularized likelihood framework, CliP takes only 16 hours to process WGS data from 2,778 tumor samples in the ICGC-PCAWG study, and 38 hours to process WES data from 9,564 tumor samples in the TCGA study. In summary, a penalized likelihood framework for subclonal reconstruction will help address intrinsic drawbacks of existing methods and expand the scope of computational analysis for cancer evolution in large cancer genomic studies.

											<h3>A pedigree-based prediction model identifies
carriers of deleterious de novo mutations
in families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
</h3>
											<p>De novo mutations (DNMs) are increasingly recognized as rare disease causal factors. Identifying DNM carriers will allow
researchers to study the likely distinct molecular mechanisms of DNMs. We developed Famdenovo to predict DNM status
(DNM or familial mutation [FM]) of deleterious autosomal dominant germline mutations for any syndrome. We introduce
Famdenovo.TP53 for Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and analyze 324 LFS family pedigrees from four US cohorts: a validation
set of 186 pedigrees and a discovery set of 138 pedigrees. The concordance index for Famdenovo.TP53 prediction was 0.95
(95% CI: [0.92, 0.98]). Forty individuals (95% CI: [30, 50]) were predicted as DNM carriers, increasing the total number
from 42 to 82. We compared clinical and biological features of FM versus DNM carriers: (1) cancer and mutation spectra
along with parental ages were similarly distributed; (2) ascertainment criteria like early-onset breast cancer (age 20â€“35
yr) provides a condition for an unbiased estimate of the DNM rate: 48% (23 DNMs vs. 25 FMs); and (3) hotspot mutation
R248W was not observed in DNMs, although it was as prevalent as hotspot mutation R248Q in FMs. Furthermore, we introduce Famdenovo.BRCA for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and apply it to a small set of family data from
the Cancer Genetics Network. In summary, we introduce a novel statistical approach to systematically evaluate deleterious
DNMs in inherited cancer syndromes. Our approach may serve as a foundation for future studies evaluating how new deleterious mutations can be established in the germline, such as those in TP53.</p>
